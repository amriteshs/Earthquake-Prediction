# Earthquake-Prediction
To predict the time that an earthquake will occur in a laboratory test using Scikit-Learn (Pedregosa et al. (2011), XGBoost (Chen &amp; Guestrin, 2016) and LightGBM (Ke, et al., 2017) libraries for machine learning and support. The laboratory test applies shear forces to a sample of earth and rock containing a fault line. If the physics are ultimately shown to scale from the laboratory to the field, researchers will have the potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could save lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure. The metric used is Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and thus a lower value is better with zero representing a perfect fit.
